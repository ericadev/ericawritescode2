I have recently completed the first semester of the Applied AI & ML Program, which is a post-graduate certificate program at Conestoga College.

We covered topics including Careers and Ethics as well as Agile Prototyping, Machine Learning Programming, Foundations of Machine Learning Frameworks, Math for AI, and Math for Data Analysis. We began with an introduction to Python and Git and covered a wide range of ML and AI topics. We included supervised and unsupervised learning, classifications and regressions, and so much more. We were introduced to Pandas and Numpy as well as Scikit Learn, Pytorch, and Tensorflow. 

I'm excited to see what comes in the next semester, including Reinforcement Learning along with Case Studies in AI, Projects in ML, AI for Business Decisions, and Applications in Industry.

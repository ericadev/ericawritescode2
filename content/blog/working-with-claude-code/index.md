I recently set up Claude Code to work on a project management tool and a habit tracker app. It's pretty amazing what it can accomplish, but Claude Code still needs guard rails. I still manually approve changes and yet I managed to miss it committing directly to the main branch today. This despite explicit instructions never to commit to main and details on how to name and use branches in the CLAUDE.md file it should be reading. On a personal project this is not an issue, however, given a real project I should probably set up guard rails to protect the main branch from direct commits.

I expect to continue updating the CLAUDE.md file with instructions as time passes, but only as things break to help ensure it has the guard rails it needs.
